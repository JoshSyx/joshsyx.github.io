# Yoshua Ligt  

I am a first-year **Creative Media & Game Technologies** student at **Saxion Enschede**, where I have chosen the role of an **Artist / Engineer**.  

## 🎨 As an Artist  
I create **3D models, animations, and environmental art**.  

## 💻 As an Engineer  
I write **C# code** for a **Real-Time Development Platform called Unity**.  

## 🔥 Current Focus  
I am currently working on improving my **modelling skills, drawing, and 2D & 3D animation**.  
These subjects are new to me, as I spent most of my youth coding. This is why I chose the role of an **artist**—to step outside my comfort zone and learn something brand new.  

## 🎶 Hobbies  
In my free time, I enjoy:  
- Making music 🎵  
- Going out with friends 🎉  
- Drawing ✏️  
- Creating small animations (still learning!) 🎞️
